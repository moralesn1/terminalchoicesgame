# Hello and welcome to our Sequential Story Game Creator.

## Prerequisites.

* Ruby Colorize 
https://github.com/fazibear/colorize

* gem install colorize
## Running this file.


Download all the files on this list and then run the file “storygame1.rb” in your terminal.





## About this project.

This project is designed for people to create their own story and run it through terminal, the only thing missing is your own creativity! 


## Current Fixes

* fixed a bug causing the exit loop to not work properly

## Current Updates

* A new seperate file containing the stories of the application.

## Currently being developed.

Currently, we are exploring different avenues to have the game over messages output to the screen on a seperate file. However, we have run into some issues regarding this and are working diligently around this problem to make the code a lot easier to read, having all the story telling elements in a seperate folder so you can focus on creating the story rather than having to run through all the other codes.

# Built with

Ruby 2.6.0
